# rock_paper_scissors

This is the first project using JavaScript for The Odin Project. 

I hope to use my knowledge of variables, methods, and functions to create a game of rock paper scissors.

In this game, a user should be able to enter one of the three options, and check their input vs the computers randomly generated guess. We should track the amount of wins the user gets vs the computer.
